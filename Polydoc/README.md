# Broaden the Spectrum
## Hackathon: Nervos
### Gitcoin: 12) Document Porting an Existing Ethereum dApp to Polyjuice

Playing with the `Nuxt.js` framework and using the documentation and the rest of the Hackaton issues, I created extensive documentation of dApp development on Polyjuice.

- **Live documentation**: polydoc.vercel.app 
- **Github repository**: https://github.com/ririen/polydoc

> The documentation is constantly being improved as I gain new knowledge and skills.
